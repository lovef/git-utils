git-prune-merged(1)
===================

NAME
----
git-prune-merged - Checkout origin/master, delete all merged branches and prunes origin.


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git prune-merged' [options]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Checkout `origin/master`, delete all merged branches and prunes `origin`. Handy once a pull request
is merged.

Use `--sync` to fetch `origin/master` before pruning.


OPTIONS
-------

-s::
--sync::
	Fetch `origin/master` from origin before checkout


NOTES
-----

Currently avoids deleting local `master` even if it is merged to `origin/master`, this might
change in the future.
