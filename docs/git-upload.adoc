git-upload(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-upload - Uploads current branch to remote


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git upload' [options] [<target-branch>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Uploads current branch to an existing remote tracking branch. If no remote branch exist
then a new branch is created.

When creating a new remote branch it will be named 'user-name'/'local-branch-name' or
'user-name'/target='target-branch'/'local-branch-name', where user name is the first
part of the configured email `git config user.email` (before '@').

Default target branch is origin/master. If the target is not origin/master
then the target branch name will be included in the generated tracking
branch name.

Target branch name should be provided without remote name and may not contain '/'.

Once tracking branch is setup for target branch then it needs not be provided
as a parameter in subequent uploads.

Target branch may be changed by using the `-n`option.


OPTIONS
-------

-n::
--new-branch::
	Push to new branch even if tracking branch already exists. Can be used
	to configure a new target branch.

-f::
--force::
	Force push. Use with care as this can erase work on the remote branch.


NOTES
-----

Using the `--force` should be done with care to avoid loss of precious data.
