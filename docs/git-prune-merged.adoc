SYNOPSIS

[verse]
'git prune-merged' [options] [<target-branch>]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Checkout target branch (default `origin/master`) delete all merged branches and prunes `origin`.
Handy once a pull request is merged.

Target branch can be passed as parameter or specified in target branch
through git upload [<target-branch>].

Use `--sync` to fetch target branch before pruning.

Currently avoids deleting local `master` even if it is merged to `origin/master`, this might
change in the future.
