git-upload(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-upload - Uploads current branch to remote


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git upload' [options]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Uploads current branch to an existing remote tracking branch. If no remote branch exist
then a new branch is created.

When creating a new remote branch it will be named 'user-name'/'local-branch-name', where
user name is the first part of the configured email `git config user.email` (before '@').


OPTIONS
-------

-n::
--new-branch::
	Push to new branch even if tracking branch already exists

-f::
--force::
	Force push. Use with care as this can erase work on the remote branch.


NOTES
-----

Using the `--force` should be done with care to avoid loss of precious data.
